# Chip plugin

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

The built-in `chip` plugin generates verification-oriented behavioral
specifications for Chisel and Verilog/SystemVerilog modules. It reuses the
public Stage 1–6 Pipeline for source scoping, planning, extraction, dependency
ordering, LLM scheduling, validation, retries, and traces. A chip run ends after
specification generation; it does not run software reasoning or bug validation.

## Quick start

The target must be a Git repository. Configure FM-Agent and its LLM provider as
described in the [root README](../../README.md), then run:

```bash
uv run python main.py /path/to/hardware-repo --plugin chip
```

Limit a mixed or monorepo checkout to one hardware subtree with a project-
relative directory:

```bash
uv run python main.py /path/to/repo --plugin chip --submodule rtl
```

Without `--resume`, FM-Agent starts a fresh run and replaces the existing
`fm_agent/` workspace. Resume an interrupted run with the same source scope and
configuration:

```bash
uv run python main.py /path/to/hardware-repo --plugin chip --resume
```

## Dialect selection

The plugin scans the selected source scope before Stage 1:

| In-scope source | Selected Profile |
| --- | --- |
| `.scala` or `.sc` | `chip-chisel` |
| `.v`, `.sv`, or `.svh`, with no Chisel source | `chip-verilog` |

When both dialects are present, Chisel wins and FM-Agent emits a warning. The
same run does not analyze both dialects, and there is no explicit dialect flag.
Use a narrower project directory or `--submodule` to run the intended subtree.
If no supported hardware source is found, the run fails before making LLM calls.

Hidden directories and common generated or dependency directories such as
`target`, `build`, `out`, `dist`, `node_modules`, virtual environments, and
`fm_agent` are excluded from hardware source discovery. Testbench-style files
and directories are also excluded from normal extraction.

## Chisel backends

### Source analysis

Source analysis is the default and requires no Chisel build tool. It extracts
Scala classes, objects, traits, and definitions as dependency context. Only a
declaration classified as a hardware `Module` and defining `val io` receives
standalone `_spec.md` and `_info.md` artifacts. Other declarations remain in
the dependency graph so that Bundle, trait, base-class, and companion-object
requirements can still inform module specifications.

Source analysis does not elaborate Scala. Dynamically selected
`Module(...)` constructions and dependencies created only by generators may be
unresolved; FM-Agent warns when it recognizes a dynamic construction it cannot
map. Use CIRCT when the elaborated module graph is required.

### Direct CIRCT analysis

CIRCT analysis is opt-in because FM-Agent needs an already elaborated FIRRTL
`.fir` or MLIR `.mlir` file. Install the pinned `firtool` and matching graph
pass plugin with:

```bash
./install.sh --with-chisel
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, then provide the elaborated input:

```bash
FM_AGENT_CHISEL_CIRCT_INPUT=/absolute/path/to/design.fir \
uv run python main.py /path/to/chisel-repo --plugin chip
```

The following variables override tool discovery:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `FM_AGENT_CHISEL_CIRCT_INPUT` | Elaborated `.fir` or `.mlir` input; relative paths resolve from the target repository |
| `FM_AGENT_CHISEL_CIRCT_COMMAND` | `firtool` command and fixed arguments; default `firtool` |
| `FM_AGENT_CHISEL_CIRCT_PLUGIN` | Exact graph pass plugin path |
| `FM_AGENT_CHISEL_CIRCT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Command timeout; default `180` |

The installed plugin is discovered automatically under `~/.local/lib`.
Successful direct analysis writes
`fm_agent/chisel_circt_module_graph.json`; the selected backend is also recorded
in `fm_agent/chip/eligibility.json`. Missing input, tools, incompatible output,
or execution failure produces a warning and falls back to source analysis
instead of aborting the run. See
[`tools/chisel-circt/README.md`](../../tools/chisel-circt/README.md) for manual
build details.

## Verilog/SystemVerilog backends

FM-Agent uses `verible-verilog-syntax` when that executable is available on
`PATH`. Verible supplies syntax-aware module spans and direct instantiation
edges. If it is unavailable, rejects a source file, or exposes an unsupported
syntax-tree schema, FM-Agent falls back to built-in source analysis. A valid
Verible result with no dependencies remains authoritative for a leaf module.

Force source analysis for comparison or diagnostics with:

```bash
FM_AGENT_NO_VERIBLE=1 \
uv run python main.py /path/to/verilog-repo --plugin chip
```

The source fallback recognizes common Verilog/SystemVerilog module declarations
and direct instantiations but is not a compiler or elaborator. Preprocessor-
dependent or heavily generated designs may therefore have a less complete
module graph than a Verible-backed run.

## Outputs and validation

Each eligible extracted module is stored below
`fm_agent/extracted_functions/` with two adjacent Markdown artifacts:

```text
fm_agent/extracted_functions/<unit>/
├── <Module>.<source-extension>
├── <Module>_spec.md
└── <Module>_info.md
```

- `_spec.md` describes the module's observable interface and behavioral
  contract as an FG/FC/CK coverage tree, including the mandatory `<FG-API>`
  group.
- `_info.md` records caller-driven requirements for each known direct
  dependency under `# Submodule: <DeclaredModuleName>`. A leaf uses the exact
  marker `(no submodules)`.

Both artifacts must exist and satisfy the Markdown structure before a module is
ready. Missing known dependency coverage is advisory for Chisel and blocking
for Verilog. Invalid artifacts are regenerated through the public Stage 6 retry
path. Run metadata and diagnostics remain under `fm_agent/trace/`; generated
source copies are never written back to the original RTL files.

## Command-line compatibility

The chip plugin supports the common contracts for `--resume`, `--submodule`,
`--one-phase`, `--domain-knowledge`/`--knowledge`, `--extra-edge`, fresh
`--isolate` runs, and `--only-spec`. Because chip Profiles already stop after
specification generation, `--only-spec` is optional.

The plugin rejects `--incremental`, `--end-func`, `--all-bugs`,
`--bug-validator`, and `--estimate`. Rejected combinations fail before creating
or modifying the run workspace and before invoking an LLM.

## Current limitations

- One run selects one dialect; mixed Chisel and Verilog analysis is not
  combined.
- Chip Profiles generate specifications only. They do not perform the software
  reasoning and bug-validation stages.
- Chisel source analysis cannot guarantee complete resolution of dynamic or
  elaboration-only dependencies.
- Verilog source analysis is a fallback parser, not full preprocessing and
  elaboration.
- CIRCT input generation belongs to the target project's Chisel build; FM-Agent
  consumes an elaborated `.fir` or `.mlir` file but does not run `sbt`, Mill, or
  a project generator to create it.
