</div>

FM-Agent is the first framework that realizes fully automated reasoning for large-scale systems (e.g., [Claude's C Compiler](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler) with 143K LoC).
It contains three steps:

- Specification generation: Autonomously understand developers' intent of system design. Generate correctness specification for each function.
- Code reasoning: Reason about the code against the specification without any human effort.
- Bug diagnosis: Analyze the root cause and location of bugs based on the reasoning process.

The [website](http://fm-agent.ai/) of FM-Agent provides an online service for reasoning about codebases. You can try it easily!

> **⚠️ Warning**: The effectiveness of this framework is heavily influenced by the capability of the underlying model. Weaker models may produce hallucinations, leading to incorrect reasoning conclusions. We recommend using models with strong reasoning abilities (Claude Opus 4.6/4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6) for more reliable results.

## Environment Setup

### Requirements

- Ubuntu (22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS is tested)
- Python 3.12
- pip >= 23
- [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) 2.15.0
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) 1.4.6
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [oh-my-openagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oh-my-openagent) plugin (installed via `bunx`)
- [@lucentia/opencode-trace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lucentia/opencode-trace) plugin — captures raw OpenCode LLM request/response traces (see [Structured Trace](#structured-trace))
- An LLM API key for your provider (the examples use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/))
- [Erlang Language Platform (ELP)](https://whatsapp.github.io/erlang-language-platform/docs/get-started/) — optional; required only when analyzing Erlang projects
  - The Erlang integration has been tested on Ubuntu with Erlang/OTP 26 or newer; select an ELP release binary built for a compatible OTP version.
  - rebar3 3.24.0 or newer is required for ELP to auto-discover projects containing `rebar.config`.
  - The macOS Erlang toolchain has not been tested as part of this integration; `./install.sh --with-erlang` installs the current Homebrew formula versions.

#### Tested macOS Environment

The following macOS environment has been tested with the install script:

- macOS 14.5 (Build 23F79), arm64
- Darwin 23.5.0
- Python 3.11.7
- pip 23.3.1
- uv 0.7.9
- OpenCode 1.17.9
- Bun/bunx 1.3.14
- Homebrew 6.0.3
- UnZip 6.00

### Install Dependencies

Set the LLM API key used by both FM-Agent and OpenCode. We recommend [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/): FM-Agent invokes LLMs concurrently, and OpenRouter is generous on RPM (requests per minute) and TPM (tokens per minute) — but any compatible provider works.

The easiest setup path is the interactive wizard:

```bash
uv run python src/configure_llm.py
```

It previews the changes, backs up existing files, updates the active FM-Agent
TOML file, stores
the API key in `.env` plus a private local key file for standalone OpenCode, and syncs the matching OpenCode provider entry in
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or the platform-equivalent config path)
without requiring you to hand-edit JSON.
If you choose `auto`, `codex-cli`, or `claude-cli` in the wizard, it updates the
backend in the active FM-Agent TOML file and clears stale non-secret LLM
overrides from the project `.env`. Any model and effort values found there are
first retained in the TOML; no API key or OpenCode provider setup is needed.

If you prefer to edit files manually, put your API key in `.env` (gitignored,
loaded automatically via python-dotenv); every other setting has a committed
default in `fm-agent.toml`. Copy the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set LLM_API_KEY
```

```bash
# .env  (secret only)
LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Non-secret settings — model, endpoint, backend, provider, etc. — live in
`fm-agent.toml` under `[llm]`. Edit them there for a permanent change. To
override without touching the committed file — e.g. on a git clone you update
with `git pull` — set the matching environment variable in `.env` or your
shell. Precedence is `env > .env > fm-agent.toml`; because `.env` wins over the
toml, a stale value there overrides a later toml edit, so check `.env` first if
a change isn't taking effect. The wizard removes the common legacy LLM override
keys from `.env` for you. See [docs/config_llm.md](docs/config_llm.md) for
details and OpenCode provider setup. The wizard also warns about LLM variables
already exported by the launching shell; use its displayed `unset` command
before starting FM-Agent if the saved configuration should take effect.

To change just one non-secret LLM setting without manually editing the file,
use the configuration command. For example, select the local Codex CLI backend:

```bash
uv run python src/configure_llm.py set --backend codex-cli
```

It previews and backs up `fm-agent.toml`, then changes only the setting(s) you
pass. The command also supports `--name`, `--provider`, `--base-url`,
`--effort`, and `--api-style`; see [docs/config_llm.md](docs/config_llm.md) for
the complete syntax. It warns when a legacy `.env` value would still override a
requested TOML setting.

Then, all of the above dependencies (except Ubuntu and Python) can be installed via the provided script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Erlang support is optional because its toolchain is not needed for other languages. To install or verify Erlang/OTP 26+, rebar3 3.24.0+, and a compatible ELP release automatically, run:

```bash
./install.sh --with-erlang
```

The Erlang option uses Homebrew on macOS and the RabbitMQ Team Erlang PPA on Ubuntu when the system OTP is missing or too old. The Ubuntu configuration has been tested with Erlang/OTP 26+; the macOS Erlang configuration has not been tested and uses the current formula versions selected by Homebrew. On Linux, rebar3 and ELP are installed into `~/.local/bin`; ensure this directory is on `PATH` in new shells. You can still install these tools manually, verify `rebar3 version` and `elp version`, and set `ELP_COMMAND` to an absolute ELP path if needed.

FM-Agent configures OpenCode's provider automatically from `fm-agent.toml`, so
you do not need to hand-edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for the model
or key. The configuration wizard above can still keep that file synchronized for
standalone OpenCode usage by writing the API key to a private provider-specific
key file under your user state/config directory (see [docs/config_llm.md](docs/config_llm.md)).
If you already use `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, the wizard updates that file instead of
the default global path. It also honors `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, using that
directory's `opencode.jsonc` when present or its `opencode.json` otherwise.

**Important:** FM-Agent automatically derives test cases based on the reasoning process to trigger potential bugs, which help developers locate and fix them. Before running FM-Agent, please ensure the execution environment for test cases is ready. If project-specific validation instructions are needed, provide them with `--bug-validator`; otherwise, the agent will decide how to execute the tests.

## Configuration

Settings live in [`fm-agent.toml`](fm-agent.toml) (with inline comments); each can also be overridden by its environment variable. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full reference of every parameter, default, and description.

(Optional) FM-Agent uses oh-my-openagent plugin to enhance OpenCode. The comment-checker hook built into this plugin should be disabled, otherwise it may intercept every comment block that FM-Agent writes, which are specifications of functions. It may force the agent to waste tokens justifying or removing them.
You can open your oh-my-openagent config file (typically ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.json) and add disabled_hooks:

```json
{
  "disabled_hooks": ["comment-checker"],
}
```

### Structured Trace

FM-Agent always writes structured execution traces under `fm_agent/trace/`:

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `fm_agent/trace/events.jsonl` | Structured events for OpenCode calls and verification LLM calls |
| `fm_agent/trace/payloads/` | Event payloads such as OpenCode stdout and selected LLM messages |
| `fm_agent/trace/opencode/` | Optional raw OpenCode LLM request/response JSONL files |

To capture raw OpenCode LLM traffic, install the OpenCode trace plugin manually by adding it to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@lucentia/opencode-trace"]
}
```

FM-Agent automatically passes `TRACE_DIR` and `TRACE_FILENAME` to each OpenCode process. The plugin writes `fm_agent/trace/opencode/<event_id>.jsonl`, where `<event_id>` matches the corresponding `opencode_call` event in `events.jsonl`.
OpenCode may cache the `@latest` package; to force a refresh, remove `~/.cache/opencode/packages/@lucentia/opencode-trace@latest`.


## Quick Start

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> [--resume] [--all-bugs] [--domain-knowledge FILE ...] [--bug-validator FILE] [--submodule PATH [PATH ...]]
```

| Argument                    | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proj_dir`                  | Directory of codebase that you want to check correctness                                        |
| `--resume`                  | Continue a previous, interrupted run instead of starting over                                   |
| `--incremental INTENT_FILE` | Run in incremental mode. The value is the path to an intent file describing the goal of the modification. |
| `--all-bugs`                | Continue reasoning after a mismatch and report every candidate. Full and incremental modes validate each candidate. |
| `--domain-knowledge FILE [FILE ...]` | Copy extra Markdown domain-knowledge files into the run and provide them to setup, spec generation, and bug validation agents. Alias: `--knowledge`; may be repeated. |
| `--bug-validator FILE`       | Use a custom Markdown prompt for bug validation instead of the built-in `md/bug_validator.md`. |
| `--isolate`                 | Run against an isolated git worktree snapshot of the project instead of the project directory itself. |
| `--submodule PATH [PATH ...]` | Only process source code under one or more subdirectories of `proj_dir`. |
| `--extra-edge FILE`         | Add supplemental caller-to-callee edges to the static call graph from a JSON file or directory. |
| `--only-spec`               | Only generate behavioral specs; skip the reasoning and bug validation stages. Cannot be combined with `--incremental`. |
| `--estimate`                | Scan scope and print a history-based time, LLM-call, token, and cost estimate without making LLM calls. |
| `--plugin NAME`             | Load a pipeline plugin from `plugins/NAME/`. |
| `--list-plugin`             | List valid pipeline plugins and exit. |

### Pipeline plugins

FM-Agent plugins can pass, replace, or modify each of the six pipeline stages
through trusted Python hooks. Every hook uses the same signature:

```python
def hook(proj_dir: str) -> None:
    ...
```

See [Pipeline Plugins](docs/plugins.md) for the plugin layout, JSON
configuration, execution modes, lifecycle, and trust boundary.

`proj_dir` must be a git repository.

### Pre-run estimate

Inspect the planned source scope before spending any model tokens:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --estimate
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --estimate --submodule src/core src/runtime
```

The preflight lists included and excluded directories, included/excluded source
file counts, an approximate function count from local extraction, and the six
analysis stages. When completed runs are available, it scales their actual
duration, LLM-call count, token usage, and cost by the current function count
(falling back to file count) and reports a range. Every projected value is
labelled **ESTIMATE**; with no completed history it reports that the estimate is
unavailable instead of inventing a number.

Successful-run summaries are retained in `fm_agent/history.jsonl` across fresh
runs. A normal run also generates `fm_agent/estimate.json` before its first LLM
stage, so the live dashboard can show the same preflight alongside actual usage.

To provide project-specific domain knowledge without editing FM-Agent's built-in prompts, pass one or more Markdown files:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --domain-knowledge docs/invariants.md docs/protocol.md
```

FM-Agent stages these files under `fm_agent/spec_prompts/domain_context/user_knowledge/` for the current run. You can also set `FM_AGENT_DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE` to an `os.pathsep`-separated list of Markdown files.

To customize how candidate bugs are tested, pass a Markdown file with
`--bug-validator`:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --bug-validator prompts/compiler_bug_validator.md
```

The selected file replaces the built-in `md/bug_validator.md` instructions.
When a custom `--bug-validator` is used for `--all-bugs` candidate validation,
FM-Agent specifies the output path, required fields, and allowed values for the
final result JSON so it can reliably read and validate the result and safely
reuse it during `--resume`.
Relative `--bug-validator` paths are resolved from the directory where
FM-Agent is launched, not from `proj_dir`.
FM-Agent still adds the current bug ID, target verification result, and any
`--domain-knowledge` files to each generated bug-validation prompt.

Use `--submodule` to limit a full or incremental run to selected project subdirectories:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --submodule src/core src/runtime
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --incremental intent.md --submodule src/core src/runtime
```

`--submodule` paths must point to directories inside `proj_dir`. The option can be combined with `--resume`, `--isolate`, and `--incremental`.

Use `--all-bugs` with full or incremental analysis:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --all-bugs
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --incremental intent.md --all-bugs
```

The option is off by default. When enabled, FM-Agent continues through later
reasoning checkpoints and writes one standard mismatch result per candidate.
Full and incremental modes validate each candidate independently.

For a result such as `path/to/function.json`, all-bugs candidates are written
beside it as `path/to/function.bug-001.json`, `bug-002.json`, and so on. The
primary result records `bug_count` and `reasoning_complete`. Resume treats a
complete primary result as the reasoning checkpoint and only reruns candidate
validations that do not yet have a terminal result. If reasoning stopped partway
through, FM-Agent clears that function's intermediate candidates and validations
and reruns the function without disturbing completed functions.

By default, every invocation wipes the existing `fm_agent/` directory and restarts from scratch, so an interrupted run loses all prior progress. Pass `--resume` (or set the environment variable `FM_AGENT_RESUME=1`) to continue where the previous run left off. In resume mode FM-Agent keeps the existing `fm_agent/` directory and only does the remaining work. Resume with the same reasoning mode: an all-bugs workspace requires `--resume --all-bugs`; default-mode resume rejects it so existing candidates and validation records are not mixed with legacy output.

Use `--only-spec` to stop after generating behavioral specs, skipping the reasoning and bug validation stages. This produces adjacent `.spec.json` and `.info.json` metadata files for each function without spending time on verification, which is useful when you only want the specs or want to review them before running the full analysis. It cannot be combined with `--incremental`, which is inherently a reasoning/bug-validation flow.

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --only-spec
```

Use `--extra-edge FILE` when the static parser cannot see an important call relationship, such as indirect syscall dispatch. Supplemental edges are applied to full and incremental runs. The JSON shape is:

```json
{
  "edges": [
    {
      "caller": {
        "fqn": "third_party::musl::src::time::nanosleep-c::nanosleep",
        "callsite_names": ["nanosleep"]
      },
      "callee": {
        "fqn": "kernel::liteos_a::syscall::time_syscall-c::SysNanoSleep",
        "info_names": ["__NR_nanosleep", "SYS_nanosleep", "nanosleep"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Extra-edge field rules:

- `caller.fqn`: exact FQN for a single caller, adding one edge to `callee.fqn`. It may be empty.
- `caller.callsite_names`: source callsite function names. Any function containing these callsites becomes a caller and gets an edge to `callee.fqn`. It may be empty.
  - At least one of `caller.fqn` and `caller.callsite_names` must be non-empty.
- `callee.fqn`: exact FQN for a single callee.
- `callee.info_names`: optional names used to match callee entries in generated `.info.json` files. They are only used for `.info.json` matching and passing caller expectations.

### Incremental Mode

In incremental mode, FM-Agent reuses the results of a previous run and only re-checks what changed. It diffs the current code against the commit recorded by the previous run in `fm_agent/version.log`. Each run records the processed commit id to that file, so a subsequent `--incremental` run automatically picks it up:

```bash
python3 main.py <proj_dir> --incremental <intent_file>
```

If `fm_agent/version.log` does not exist (no previous run to compare against), FM-Agent falls back to a full run.

### Live Dashboard

FM-Agent ships a standalone real-time TUI dashboard ([dashboard.py](dashboard.py)) that visualizes a run as it progresses: pre-run scope and estimates, per-stage progress, token usage and cost, prompt-cache hit rate, and bug-validation verdicts. It reads the trace files FM-Agent writes under `fm_agent/`, so run it in a second terminal while `main.py` is going:

```bash
uv run python dashboard.py <proj_dir>
```

Alternatively, start it automatically from the main command; it monitors the
current run's workspace (including isolated runs) and is stopped when the run
finishes:

```bash
uv run python main.py <proj_dir> --dashboard
```

To generate and display only the pre-run estimate, without starting the
pipeline or making LLM calls:

```bash
uv run python dashboard.py <proj_dir> --estimate
uv run python dashboard.py <proj_dir> --estimate --submodule src/core src/runtime
```

| Argument    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proj_dir`  | Same codebase directory passed to `main.py` (monitors `<proj_dir>/fm_agent/`). You can also point it directly at any workspace directory containing a `trace/` subdir, e.g. an archived run |

Press `Ctrl-C` to exit the dashboard; it does not affect the running pipeline.

### Output

FM-Agent creates an `fm_agent/` directory under your codebase directory. The key outputs are:

#### Bug Reports (`fm_agent/bug_validation/<bug_id>.md`)

Each confirmed or investigated bug produces a Markdown report containing:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Specification Claim | The post-condition that the function specification requires |
| Actual Behavior | The post-condition that the code actually implements |
| Code Evidence | The specific code statements (with line numbers) that cause the violation |
| Trigger Condition | A description of the condition that triggers the bug |
| How to Trigger | Concrete input parameters, expected vs. actual output, and reproduction steps |
| Probe Script | The full test script used to confirm the bug |
| Probe Output | Raw stdout from executing the probe script |

A `summary.json` file in `fm_agent/bug_validation/` aggregates all bug results
with counts of total reported, confirmed, not confirmed bugs. In `--all-bugs`
mode, the summary additionally reports pending candidates; a missing, corrupt,
or non-terminal validation is pending instead of disappearing from the totals.
Default-mode summary behavior is unchanged.

#### Interactive Report Index (`fm_agent/report.html`)

A single self-contained `report.html` is generated automatically at the end of
every full pipeline run (spec-only mode included), aggregating both the bug
validation results and the per-function logic verification results into one
browseable page. It is rendered purely from the run artifacts — no LLM calls,
no network, no extra dependencies.

Each row shows the report title, a status badge, the source file (linked back
to the original source), the function name, and a code location. The page
supports:

- **Search** across title, source file, function name, and code location
- **Filter** by status (`confirmed_bug` / `potential_bug`)
  and by source file
  (collapsible path tree; checking a directory selects all files under it).
- **Sort** by status, source file, or function name
- **Expand / collapse** individual reports or all reports at once, plus a
  reset button

The page is written to `fm_agent/report.html`; open it in a browser. It can
also be regenerated on demand from any existing run's artifacts with
`uv run python report.py <proj_dir>` (or pass an `fm_agent/` workspace or an
archived-workspace directory directly). The incremental pipeline
(`--incremental`) does not run the auto-generation hook — regenerate the page
manually with the same command.

## Important Notes

1. FM-Agent will create an `fm_agent/` directory under your codebase directory. Make sure there is no name conflict.
2. The markdown files under `md/` provide general instructions that guide the agent's reasoning process. Prefer `--domain-knowledge` for project-specific context such as invariants, protocols, encoding rules, and domain terminology. For project-specific bug-validation procedures, use `--bug-validator` instead of editing the built-in prompt; for example, a compiler-specific validator can instruct the agent to compare outputs against a reference implementation such as GCC.
3. **Supported languages**: Rust, C, C++, Python, Java, Go, CUDA, JavaScript, TypeScript, ArkTS, Erlang. Erlang function extraction and call graphs require ELP; if ELP is unavailable, Erlang files are skipped with a warning.
